# DNS-Work in Progress

Welcome to my website, where I manage and showcase all my unused domains. This platform serves as a digital parking lot for my domain collection, allowing me to keep track of them and potentially develop them in the future.
In addition to domain management, I have also implemented a list of my current projects. This section provides a glimpse into my ongoing work and the various initiatives I am involved in.
Lastly, I have a dedicated page about myself. Here, you can learn more about me, my background, and my interests. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or would like to collaborate on a project.
